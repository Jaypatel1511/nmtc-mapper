# Changelog

All notable changes to nmtc-mapper are documented here.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **CDFI Fund download URL** — The Aug 2025 CDFI Fund site update moved the
  NMTC eligibility file to a new path and changed the format from `.xlsx` to
  `.xlsb`. The previous URL returned HTTP 404, causing every fresh install to
  silently fall back to the 12-tract sample dataset and classify all real tracts
  as ineligible.

### Added
- **`.xlsb` format support** — Added `pyxlsb>=1.0.0` as a dependency and a new
  `_load_xlsb_table()` parser in `data/loader.py`. The loader now detects file
  format by extension and routes accordingly; the legacy `.xlsx` path is
  preserved as a fallback.
- **CDFI Fund pre-computed distress flags** — The Aug 2025 file ships its own
  `Severe distress` and `Deep distress` YES/NO columns computed by CDFI Fund
  staff. `_load_xlsb_table()` reads these directly instead of recomputing from
  raw thresholds, keeping classification consistent with official CDFI Fund
  determinations.
